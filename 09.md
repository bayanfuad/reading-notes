# Redux
-------
Redux provides a solid, stable, and mature solution to managing state in React application. Through a handful of small, useful patterns, Redux can transform your application from a total mess of confusing and scattered state, into a delightfully organized, easy to understand modern JavaScript powerhouse. So itâ€™s is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

---------
## Redux Store
the store is the object that brings them together. The store has the following responsiblities:

-holds application state.

-allows access to state via getState().

-allows state to be updated via dispatch(action).

-registers listeners via subscribe(listener).

-handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscribe(listener).

-the store is created by passing the root reducer function to createStore().

## one-way data flow
-State describes the condition of the app at a specific point in time.
-The UI is rendered based on that state.
-When something happens (such as a user clicking a button), the state is updated based on what occurred.
-The UI re-renders based on the new state.
