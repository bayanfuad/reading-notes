 # Stack and Queues
 
 
## What's the difference between Stack and Queue?
| Stack |Queues |
| --- | ----------- |
| The stack is based on LIFO(Last In First Out) principle |The queue is based on FIFO(First In First Out) principle.|
| Insertion Operation is called Push Operation |Insertion Operation is called Enqueue Operation.|
| Deletion Operation is called Pop Operation |Deletion Operation is called Dequeue Operation.|
| Push and Pop Operation takes place from one end of the stack |Enqueue and Dequeue Operation takes place from a different end of the queue.|
| The most accessible element is called Top and the least accessible is called the Bottom of the stack |The insertion end is called Rear End and the deletion end is called the Front End.|

## What is Stacks and how to use it?
 
 Stack is a linear data structure that follows the specific order to perform the operations. For example, if we want to access the element in the array we can do it any time but in the case of stack data structure, there is only one sequence to access the element.

## some stack applications: 
-Stack is used in expression conversion. For example, infix to postfix or prefix to postfix
-Stack is used in memory management
-It is used in java virtual machine
-It is used for the Backtracking problem-solving method
-It is used in string parsing or string reversal.
-Stack is used to matching the HTML tags in web development
 
 ## What is Queue?
 The queue is a linear data structure in which we can insert the element from one side of the list and delete the element from the other side of the list. The end of the list from where the elements are inserted is called the rear end and the end from where the elements are deleted is called the front end.

## some queue applications:
Queues are used in routers and switches
In networking, the queue is used when data is transferred asynchronously
Used in maintaining the playlist in media players
Used to handle interrupts in the operating system
The queue is used in the round-robin scheduling algorithm
