## What Is a Graph
------
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph can be defined as, A Graph consisting of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of edges that connect a pair of nodes.
## Types of Graph
-----
there're a lot of types of graphs, the most important are:

weighted graph / unweighted graph
directed graph / undirected graph
a weighted graph is when the edge (connection) between two verticies have a weight (value). a directed graph is when the edge (connection) between two verticies have a direction (a pointer from one node to another)

## Basic Properties of a Graph
----------
Distance between two Vertices: It is basically the number of edges that are available in the shortest path between vertex A and vertex B.If there is more than one edge which is used to connect two vertices then we basically considered the shortest path as the distance between these two vertices.
## Trees and Graphs
a Tree is a special graph that has these special properties:

_Trees are always directed
_There is a unique node called root(parent) node in Trees.
-There will not be any cycle in a Tree.
