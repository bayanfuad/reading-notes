## Who is Roy Fielding?

that person who created the HTTP protocol.

## Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.
