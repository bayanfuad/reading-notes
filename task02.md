## Growth mindset
Carol Dweck researches “growth mindset” — the idea that we can grow our brain's capacity to learn and to solve problems. In this talk, she describes two ways to think about a problem that’s slightly too hard for you to solve. Are you not smart enough to solve it … or have you just not solved it yet? A great introduction to this influential field.
## Duckworth on Grit
Leaving a high-flying job in consulting, Angela Lee Duckworth took a job teaching math to seventh graders in a New York public school. She quickly realized that IQ wasn't the only thing separating the successful students from those who struggled.She explained her theory of "grit" as a predictor of success and how having a passion toward something could change every thing.
## A kinder, gentler philosophy of success | Alain de Botton
Alain de Botton points out that meritocracy includes both the positive idea that each of us can climb to the top and the negative idea that those who are at the bottom deserve it. He goes on to suggest that we learn to read tragedy (Euripides, Sophocles, Shakespeare) because it is the art form that best combats the view that people have earned their poverty or unfortunate circumstances. He specifically mentions Hamlet, pointing out, "Hamlet loses, but you wouldn't call Hamlet a loser." Funny how meritocracy leads back to the middle age's concept of the great chain of being--everyone has a place in the hierarchy, and everyone belongs in the place he's in.
