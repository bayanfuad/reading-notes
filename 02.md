# SQL database, ORM, Sequelize 

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

Each query begins with finding the data that we need in a database, and then filtering that data down into something that can be processed and understood as quickly as possible. Because each part of the query is executed sequentially, it's important to understand the order of execution so that you know what results are accessible where.
