# SQL database, ORM, Sequelize 

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

Each query begins with finding the data that we need in a database, and then filtering that data down into something that can be processed and understood as quickly as possible. Because each part of the query is executed sequentially, it's important to understand the order of execution so that you know what results are accessible where.

## What's the difference between SQL  and NoSQL?

| SQL |NoSQL |
| --- | ----------- |
| Relational database management system|Distributed database management system  |
| Vertically scalable|Horizontally scalable  |
| Fixed or predefined schema|Dynamic schema  |
| Not suitable for hierarchical data storage|Best suitable for hierarchical data storage |
| Can be used for complex queries|Not good for complex queries  |

## What is Sequlize and how to use it with Node js?
Sequelize is a modern TypeScript and Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and SQL Server, and more. Featuring solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.

-Sequelize is a third-party package to be precise its an Object-Relational Mapping Library(ORM)..
-Standardization ORMs usually have a single schema definition in the code. This makes it very clear what the schema is, and very simple to change it.
-No need to learn SQL â€“ queries are written in plain JavaScript.

## What is an ORM, how does it work, and how should I use one?
Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a programming technique in which a metadata descriptor is used to connect object code to a relational database. Object code is written in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages such as Java or C#. ORM converts data between type systems that are unable to coexist within relational databases and OOP languages.
## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**WRRC** : The request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren't working).

**A database schema** : represents the logical configuration of all or part of a relational database.

**NoSQL databases**: are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model.
