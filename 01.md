## What's the difference between PUT and PATCH?

-POST ===> always for creating a resource (does not matter if it was duplicated).

-PUT ===> for checking if resource exists then update, else create new resource.

-PATCH ===> always for updating a resource.

## Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to "mock" an API for development like json-server

1-[Postman Mock Server](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/).

2-[reqres](https://reqres.in/).

3-[mocki.io](https://mocki.io/fake-json-api).

## Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

apiDocjs: Inline Documentation for RESTful web APIs. It creates a documentation from API annotations in your source code. It includes a default template which uses handlebars, Bootstrap, RequireJS and jQuery for the output of the generated apidata.js and apiproject.js as a html-page;  
Swagger Inspector: Test and Document Your APIs With Ease. It is a free cloud-based API testing and documentation tool to simplify the validation of any API and generate its corresponding OpenAPI documentation. 

## Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST
1) SOAP
- Communication happens using XML only
- Request is sent to SOAP methods
- Documentation is in WSDL (Wizdal)
- Heavy, more secure, more stable
- getting less popular
2) REST API
- Communication happens using Json, XML
- Requests are sent to API methods/urls using
- Communication happens in HTTP(Internet)
- Lightweight, stable
- Easy to develop and automate
- very popular

## Express Js
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It facilitates the rapid development of Node based Web applications. Following are some of the core features of Express framework

-Allows to set up middlewares to respond to HTTP Requests.

-Defines a routing table which is used to perform different actions based on HTTP Method and URL.

-Allows to dynamically render HTML Pages based on passing arguments to templates
