# The OSI Model

The OSI model is a conceptual framework that is used to describe how a network functions.
## The OSI Layers

**OSI Layer 1**
Layer 1 is the physical layer. Thereâ€™s a lot of technology in Layer 1 - everything from physical network devices, cabling, to how the cables hook up to the devices.

**OSI Layer 2**
Layer 2 is the data link layer. Layer 2 defines how data is formatted for transmission, how much data can flow between nodes, for how long, and what to do when errors are detected in this flow.

**OSI Layer 3**
Layer 3 is the network layer. This is where we send information between and across networks through the use of routers. Instead of just node-to-node communication, we can now do network-to-network communication.

**OSI Layer 4**
Layer 4 is the transport layer. This where we dive into the nitty gritty specifics of the connection between two nodes and how information is transmitted between them. It builds on the functions of Layer 2 - line discipline, flow control, and error control.

**OSI Layer 5**
Layer 5 is the session layer. This layer establishes, maintains, and terminates sessions.

**OSI Layer 6**
Layer 6 is the presentation layer. This layer is responsible for data formatting, such as character encoding and conversions, and data encryption.

**OSI Layer 7**
Layer 7 is the application layer.this is the layer that is ultimately responsible for supporting services used by end-user applications. Applications include software programs that are installed on the operating system, like Internet browsers (for example, Firefox) or word processing programs (for example, Microsoft Word).


# Socket io
-Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.

-All the frequently updated applications used WebSocket because it is faster than HTTP Connection. When we do not want to retain a connection for a particular amount of time or reuse the connection for transmitting data; An HTTP connection is slower than WebSockets.

-Socket.IO is an event-driven library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It consists of two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. Both components have a nearly identical API.

-Socket.IO primarily uses the WebSocket protocol with polling as a fallback option, while providing the same interface. Although it can be used simply as a wrapper for WebSockets, it provides many more features, including broadcasting to multiple sockets, storing data associated with each client, and asynchronous I/O.
