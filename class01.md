# Component-Based Architecture

## What is a “component”?

-A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

-The primary objective of component-based architecture is to ensure component reusability.

## What are the characteristics of a component?

-Reusability

-Replaceable

-Not context specific

-Extensible

-Encapsulated

-Independent

## What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

-Ease of deployment (no conflicts when updating the version to a new one).

-Reduced cost (when you use a third party component it will reduce the cost of development and maintenance).

-Ease of development (when you use a component with good code it will not affect other components in your system).

-Reusable (you can use the same component in other systems and applications).

-Modification of technical complexity.

-Reliability (when each component is reliable, then the reliability of the whole system will improve).

-System maintenance and evolution (you can edit and change the component easily without affecting the rest components in your system).

-Independent (each component designed to have a minimal limit of dependencies of other components).

# What is Props and How to Use it in React?

## What is props short for?

-properties.

## How are props used in React?

-by defining an attribute (props) in the parent component, then we call this attribute into child component by dot notation, props.propName. in another way; we can send data from one component to another.

## What is the flow of props?

-uni-directional flow, one-way flow: from parent to child.

## Things I want to know more about

-the component-based architecture and react.
