# Redux Advanced

## Reducers and Actions
**Reducers**

A reducer is a function that accepts a state and an action as arguments, and returns a new state result.
The reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns the next state.
The reducer function is called a reducer because it's the type of function you would pass to Array.prototype.reduce(reducer, ?initialValue).

**Actions**

-An action is a plain object that represents an intention to change the state.

-Actions are the only way to get data into the store.

-Actions must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed.

-Actions are created using action creators.

## Redux Toolkit

**Purpose of using Redux Toolkit**
The Redux core library is deliberately unopinionated. It lets you decide how you want to handle everything, like store setup, what your state contains, and how you want to build your reducers.

This is good in some cases, because it gives you flexibility, but that flexibility isn't always needed. Sometimes we just want the simplest possible way to get started, with some good default behavior out of the box. Or, maybe you're writing a larger application and finding yourself writing some similar code, and you'd like to cut down on how much of that code you have to write by hand.

**Why You Should Use Redux Toolkit?**

Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code. Redux Toolkit is beneficial to all Redux users regardless of skill level or experience. It can be added at the start of a new project, or used as part of an incremental migration in an existing project.
